# Getting Started with Amazone Clone App

This project was bootstrapped with [React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Huge thanks to Clever Programmer for the build guidance.

## App Features

This app was inspired by Amazon. It is deployed with Firebase for login and authentication, database, server storage, and APIs. Stripe was used for payments.

### `Demo`

[Test the App](https://with-a-twist-330bf.web.app/).

When at checkout, do not use real credit card information. See the [Stripe Docs](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).

Additionally, this is a demo only, so no items will be shipped your way!
